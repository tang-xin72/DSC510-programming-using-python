# DSC510-Introduction to programming using Python
This is a archive of all python programs I created as part of assignments required in DSC 510 class
this class covers all basic python program skills:

•	Create a Python Application which asks the user for their zip code or city (Your program must perform both a city and a zip lookup). You must ask the user which they want to perform with each iteration of the program.
•	Use the zip code or city name in order to obtain weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap.
•	Display the weather forecast in a readable format to the user. Do not display the weather data in Kelvin, since this is not readable to the average person.  You should allow the user to choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit and ideally also Kelvin.
•	Use comments within the application where appropriate in order to document what the program is doing. Comments should add value to the program and describe important elements of the program.
•	Use functions including a main function and a properly defined call to main. You should have multiple functions.
•	Allow the user to run the program multiple times to allow them to look up weather conditions for multiple locations.
•	Validate whether the user entered valid data. If valid data isn’t presented notify the user. Your program should never crash with bad user input.
•	Use the Requests library in order to request data from the webservice.
•	Use Try blocks to ensure that your request was successful. If the connection was not successful display a message to the user.
•	Use Python 3 and latest packages
•	Use try blocks when establishing connections to the webservice. You must print a message to the user indicating whether or not the connection was successful.
•	use proper coding convention including proper variable names (See PEP8).
